Cassandra Data Model Rules:
=============================

Maximize the number of writes
In Cassandra, writes are very cheap. Cassandra is optimized for high write performance. 
So try to maximize your writes for better read performance and data availability. 
There is a tradeoff between data write and data read. So, optimize you data read performance by maximizing the number of data writes.

Maximize Data Duplication
Data denormalization and data duplication are defacto of Cassandra. Disk space is not more expensive than memory, CPU processing and IOs operation.
As Cassandra is a distributed database, so data duplication provides instant data availability and no single point of failure.

Spread Data Evenly Around the Cluster:
Data is spread to different nodes based on partition keys that is the first part of the primary key. 
Try to choose integers as a primary key for spreading data evenly around the cluster.
